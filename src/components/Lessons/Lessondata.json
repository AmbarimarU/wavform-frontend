                "A piano is one of the most basic and vital instruments to understanding music on a fundamental level. Its ease of use and beautiful sound make it an enticing starting point for beginners. Today, we will show the very basics of understanding notes and playing them on a piano.",
                "Knowing what the notes are is the first step in understanding anything about music. The notes on the piano are ABCDEFG (white notes specifically), and this sequence repeats as you go up and down the piano. These are also all the notes used in the majority of all popular music created today. The repetition of these notes are called octaves. To understand where each note is on the piano, see the grouping of two black keys as Chopsticks, and the grouping of three black keys as a Fork. The white notes to the left of those groupings are a C and F respectively.",
                "Most popular songs have core elements to them which together create the song itself. One of these elements is the melody. Any catchy pop song usually has a very strong melody, which is usually composed of singular notes sung by someone or played on an instrument. Try playing the interactive keyboard we have and see if you can come up with a melody!",
                "Let’s try to play one of the most classic and simple tunes that pretty much everyone should know. The alphabet song! This song only uses 5 notes (C, D, E, F and G), so it should be quite easy to learn. Let’s play this sequence.  Sequence (computer keys, to the tune of the Alphabet Song): AAFFGGF FFDDSSSSA GGF DDS GGGF DDS AAFFGGF FFDDSSA"
